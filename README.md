# Game_with_raycasting

2d game written using oop in C ++.

Game idea: collect all the coins to get out of the room

In-game items: chest with random things, heal, coins


Enemies: 3 types of methods - Fast, Normal, Large. They move in a random direction as the player moves. In turn, the player must calculate each of his moves.

For educational purposes, the following programming patterns were applied: Sinleton, Iterator, Abstract Factory, Strategy, Observer, Bridge, Commands, States, Memento. A logging system is also available.

A pseudo 3D chart was chosen using raytracing.
